### 1. Shapes and Space

**Explanation:**

- **Introduction to Shapes:**
  - **What Are Shapes?**: Shapes are geometric forms that help us describe the world around us. Shapes can be found in everyday objects, from the roundness of a ball to the squareness of a picture frame.
  - **Basic Shapes**: Start with basic geometric shapes. Display each shape clearly and describe its attributes:
    - **Circle**: A shape with no sides or corners. It's round and can be seen in objects like wheels and coins.
    - **Square**: A shape with 4 equal sides and 4 corners. It’s like a chessboard or a window pane.
    - **Triangle**: A shape with 3 sides and 3 corners. It looks like a slice of pizza or a mountain peak.
    - **Rectangle**: A shape with 2 long sides and 2 short sides, with 4 corners. It’s similar to a door or a book cover.

- **Identify Basic Shapes:**
  - **Recognizing Shapes in the Environment**: Encourage students to find and name shapes in their environment. Ask questions like, “Can you find something that is shaped like a circle?” This helps them connect their knowledge to real-world objects.

- **Describe Properties of Shapes:**
  - **Sides and Corners**: Explain that shapes can be identified by their number of sides and corners. For example, a square has 4 sides and 4 corners, while a circle has none.
  - **Attributes and Examples**: Use real-life examples to illustrate properties. Show a circle by pointing to a clock, a square by showing a classroom window, a triangle by pointing to a roof, and a rectangle by displaying a book.

- **Understand Spatial Relationships:**
  - **Positioning Terms**: Teach terms like above, below, next to, in front of, and behind using physical objects. For instance, place a toy above a book and say, “The toy is above the book.”
  - **Practical Demonstrations**: Use everyday situations, such as a toy being placed in front of or behind another object, to help students understand spatial relationships.

- **Classify and Sort Shapes:**
  - **Sorting Activities**: Provide a variety of shape cutouts or toys and ask students to sort them by shape or size. For example, they might group all the circles together and all the squares together.
  - **Grouping and Classification**: Explain that sorting helps us organize objects based on their characteristics, making it easier to study and use them.
